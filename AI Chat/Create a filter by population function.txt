We're using c#10 we have a class Country with property Population of type long. 
Create a FilterByPopulation method that accepts a list of Country objects 'countries' and an int 'populationInMillions' as  parameters and return only those objects from countries where the population is less than provided int in the millions of people (if population of a country is 11000000 and populationInMillions is 10, then it filters this country out)

Certainly! You can achieve this by using LINQ's Where extension method.

Here's an example based on your requirements:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Country
{
    public long Population { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } // added a name property just for illustrative purposes.

    // ... potentially other properties and methods ...

    public static List<Country> FilterByPopulation(List<Country> countries, int populationInMillions)
    {
        return countries.Where(country => country.Population < populationInMillions * 1_000_000).ToList();
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var countries = new List<Country>
        {
            new Country { Name = "CountryA", Population = 5_000_000 },
            new Country { Name = "CountryB", Population = 11_000_000 },
            new Country { Name = "CountryC", Population = 8_000_000 }
        };

        var filteredCountries = Country.FilterByPopulation(countries, 10);

        foreach (var country in filteredCountries)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{country.Name}: {country.Population}");
        }
    }
}
In the code above, we created a FilterByPopulation static method in the Country class which filters the countries based on their populations. The method is then demonstrated in a Main method.

When the above Main method is run, it will output:

makefile
Copy code
CountryA: 5000000
CountryC: 8000000
Note: The CountryB is not output because its population is 11 million, which is greater than the provided 10 million threshold.
